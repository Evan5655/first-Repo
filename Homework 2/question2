My thoughts on the subject vary because personally I go through all the different types of learning each day, honestly the most important part of learning for me is that I can actually be interested and engaged with what we are learning. The one case that does resonate with me heavily is when I first started learning guitar, you see I have dyscalculia so numbers and math do not do very well with me and a way you can learn guitar songs and rhythm through tab which is a use of numbers and lines and dear god it was hell for me so as the years went on I dropped Tab completely and have done much much better using my ears using auditory learning
