      <span>I live in a world run by Goblins</span>
      <br />
      I do not like them, they are vacuous little vermin
      <br />
      <span>mother says I need to show them respect for they provide great beauty during the harvest</span>
    </body>
    <p>she talks of them inseminating the flowers, plumping them in such fashion that not even the earths fattest bee could dream of</p>
    <p>whilst this may be true, I am a young imbecile and don't give a damn about the harvest.</p>
    <p>I want to live without seeing their gross skin that drips with external saliva</p>
    <p>every time I step outside I can feel their gross bodys rubbing against the roses contorting and destroying their life</p>
    <p>all this for it to bloom in a later day and have the process start all over again</p>
    <p>it wasn't untill I shot one with my bow and arrow that I took him to the shade where I began</p>
    <p>THE DISSECTION</p>
    <p>soaking up it's gelatinous ooze dripping from it's ectoskeleton with a large rag, I was getting closer to the core</p>
    <p>taking my homemade chainsaw to it's stomach I knew I would find their beauty that impregnates the flowers</p>
    <p>once finally reaching the internal structure I began to sift</p>
    <p>shoving my arm up to the elbow going for what felt like lifetimes into the lifless body </p>
    <p>occasionally looking into its dead glassy eyes frightened that it would come back and ripp my Fucking head off</p>
    <p>once I felt what I believed was the heart I grabbed it firmly and began to pull</p>
    <p>awaiting the gorgeous voluptuos heart filled with what, Gold? FÃ¦? Lusty Nymphs? </p>
    <p>as I pulled with all my might I lifted the heart to the air only to look at it, with the arteries swooping back to me in a parabolic fashion</p>
    <p>I followed the entrails slowly inch by inch until I reached the point of entry: </p>
