I prefer GUIs personally because I am most comfortable on a mac and they seem to have an easy flow with the setup of them, the straightforwardness of filing and saving specific items has never been more easy and simple than that of the GUI. I have been struggling with Command line as it feels like an uphill battle right now crushing my each and every move I attempt to make causing lots of frustration
